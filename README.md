To practice my SQL skill, I took Danny MA 8 weeks SQL challenge, case study number 1.
This project gives me the ability to apply my SQL knowlege to provide answers to business questions provided,
and also derived insight that can help make a better data driven decision.

## Introduction
Danny wants to use data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they’ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

Danny has provided a sample of his overall customer data due to privacy issues - but he hopes that these examples are enough to write fully functioning SQL queries to help him answer his questions!

Danny has shared with you 3 key datasets for this case study:
![members]()
![menu]()
![sales]()
